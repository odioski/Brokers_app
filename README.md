# QUOTE+
A extremely trimmed stock picker for when you have something in mind.

# What it does...

Quote+ is a quote retriever which gives simple data per quote. It's geared to assist the once Retail Brokers and some Dividend Investors.
It does this by retrieving only pieces of data whose level of importance is subjective but valualble all the same. 

Those pieces are:

Price

Dividend (as much info that is retrievable)

Company description

It can be considered a stock picker but in my experience this data is usually sufficient enough to make a decision *as to whether to research further*.

If you like to casually browse the market but tend to get tense from information overload, this should help.

# INSTALLATION

Quote+ relies on the Polygon.io API to aggregate it's information so you'll need an API KEY from them in order to use this.
Once you have one replace *POLYGON.IO.APIKEY* within the script with your API KEY.

You'll need Python installed which can be found at https://python.org

You can run the script via your terminal or IDE.

    python Quote+.py

# SUPPORT

I'll add video's of Quote+ in action within the next week or two.
Let me know what you like or dislike or if you want something more added. Thanks.
