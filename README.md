# QUOTE+
A extremely trimmed stock picker for when you have something in mind.

# What it does...

Quote+ is a quote retriever which gives simple data per quote. It's geared to assist the once Retail Brokers and some Dividend Investors.
It does this by retrieving only pieces of data whose level of importance is subjective but valualble all the same. 

Those pieces are:

Price

Dividend (as much info that is retrievable)

Company description

It can be considered a stock picker but in my experience this data is usually sufficient enough to make a decision *as to whether to research further*.

If you like to casually browse the market but tend to get tense from information overload, this should help.
