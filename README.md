# QUOTE+
A extremely trimmed stock picker for when you have something in mind.

# What it does...

Quote+ is a quote retriever which gives simple data per quote. It's geared to assist the once Retail Brokers and some Dividend Investors.
It does this by retrieving only pieces of data whose level of importance is subjective but valualble all the same. 

Those pieces are:

-Price
-Dividend (as much info that is retrievable)
-Company description

It can be considered a stock picker but in my experience this data is usually sufficient enough to make a decision *as to whether to research further*.

If you like to casually browse the market but tend to get tense from information overload, this should help.

# INSTALLATION

You'll need Python installed which can be found at https://python.org

Navigate to /INSTALLER and run Quote+_Installer then run Quote+.exe or click the Shortcut.

You can also run the script via your terminal.

    python -m Quote+.py
